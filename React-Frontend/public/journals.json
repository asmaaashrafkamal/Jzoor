      "description": "Discover the tree that holds generations of love, land, and loss",
      "content":"There’s a reason the olive tree is called the tree of life.\n For generations across Palestine and the Mediterranean, the olive tree has stood as a symbol of resilience, belonging, and identity. Its deep roots reach into ancient soil — the same soil that carries family names, forgotten villages, and stories whispered from one generation to the next.\n But olive trees are not just cultural symbols — they are part of everyday life. Families grow up harvesting them each autumn, their hands stained with oil and earth. The process is more than agricultural; it’s ceremonial. Picking olives becomes an annual reunion — of cousins, neighbors, and elders. Everyone has a role, even the youngest child. \n Each bottle of olive oil holds the labor of love, the sting of memory, and the taste of home. It is used not just in kitchens, but in remedies, blessings, and traditions. To lose an olive tree to bulldozers or fire isn’t just a loss of income — it’s the loss of history, place, and peace. \n Still,they grow. In gardens, in refugee camps, on balconies -- in hope. \n The olive tree is more than fruit. It is heritage. It is defiance. It is love made visible in green.",

      "description": "Explore the roots of Palestine's most iconic thread",
      "content": "The kufiya (or keffiyeh) is more than just a scarf — it’s a symbol woven with resistance, identity, and memory. \n Originally worn by farmers to protect against the sun and dust, the kufiya became a national symbol during the 1936 Palestinian revolt. Black and white or red and white, its woven patterns — often mistaken as just decorative — carry powerful meanings. The bold lines represent trade routes. The fishnet-like design recalls the Mediterranean and the fishing communities. The bold, squared shapes echo olive leaves and harvest nets. \n In the decades that followed, it became a global icon of solidarity — worn by freedom fighters, students, and artists. But for Palestinians, it's deeply personal. It’s wrapped around shoulders at protests, weddings, and funerals alike. It says: I remember where I come from. \n Today, as mass production threatens to erase its roots, the last kufiya factory in Palestine — Hirbawi in Hebron — continues to produce them on traditional looms, thread by thread. \n Wearing the kufiya isn’t just fashion. It’s a quiet, powerful act of remembering.",

      "description": "A beginner’s guide to planting, watering, and harvesting zaatar at home",
      "content": "Za’atar is more than just a spice — it’s a plant full of history, flavor, and tradition. Growing it at home is not only easy, but deeply rewarding. \n 🌱 1. Choose a Sunny Spot \n Za’atar loves the sun. Whether you're planting it in a garden or a pot, make sure it gets at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. \n 🪴 2. Well-Drained Soil Is Key \n This plant doesn't like wet roots. Use sandy or rocky soil and make sure your pot or garden bed drains well. \n 💧 3. Water Lightly \n Let the soil dry out between waterings. Think “drought-tolerant” — overwatering can harm its roots.\n ✂️ 4. Prune Often \n Trimming the plant encourages bushier growth. Pick leaves regularly to use fresh in your dishes or dry them for your own za’atar blend. \n 🌾 5. Harvest With Care \n Once the plant is full and healthy, you can begin harvesting. Early morning is best, when the oils are most concentrated. \n Za’atar is hardy, beautiful, and deeply tied to Palestinian heritage. Grow it not just as a plant — but as a connection to home.",

      "title": "The Art of Palestinian Embroidery",
      "description": "A stitch through history, identity, and resistance.",
      "content":"Every thread tells a story. Palestinian embroidery, known as tatreez, is more than decorative stitching — it’s a language passed from mother to daughter, a quiet act of remembrance, and a form of cultural resistance. Each pattern, color, and motif has meaning. Some mark a woman’s village or marital status. Others, like the olive branch or watermelon, carry political symbolism — especially during times when national expression was restricted. The watermelon, for instance, became a symbol of resistance after the Palestinian flag was banned. Tatreez has always adapted. Today, artists incorporate traditional motifs into bags, jackets, and accessories, keeping the heritage alive while making it accessible to younger generations. At its heart, Palestinian embroidery is about survival — of identity, of beauty, and of belonging stitched into every square.",
